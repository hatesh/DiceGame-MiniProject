*UoL CS | CO2001 | Coursework | 2018-2019*

## Part 1 ( 20 Marks)

### Welcome Message

- [ ] The game begins with an appropriate well-designed welcome message.

### Dice Roll

- [ ] Your application simulates the dice roll operation for both players.
- [ ] Computer generates 3 random numbers between 1-6 (simulating a 6 sided dice), for each player.
- [ ] The players’ scores are updated every time dice roll button clicked for each player.

### Scoring

- [ ] If it generates a pair, then the player score is the sum of that pair. For example if it generates 3 & 3 & 1, the player scores will be the sum of 3 & 3 which is 6.
- [ ] If all the 3 dice rolls have the same values, then the score will be 18.
- [ ] Otherwise, for any other combination, they just get 1 score.
- [ ] If both players reaches a score which is more than the pre-defined maximum, the game’s result is a Draw
- [ ] A player is considered a winner if he/she accumulates a score which is more than the predefined maximum.

- [ ] At every state of the game, both players’ score must be displayed together with the name of the player who is leading the game.
